# BLANKS üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
> Fill in the empty spaces.
> Reduce the space between us.

Created for the [js13k](https://js13kgames.com/) competition 2021

# Gameplay
BLANKS üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  &nbsp; is a puzzle game in the style of the zebra puzzle.  The cases are randomly generated in the browser and get progressively more difficult. The player must read the clues to fill in the empty spaces and solve the case.

Periodically the player gets the 'case files' screen where they can choose the size of their next case or play one of the community cases submitted to the NEXT blockchain.

If you play with sound & solve the puzzle before 'possible solution', you hear '100%'.

# Theme
The theme of the competition was **SPACE**.
The game uses that theme by:
* Filling in the empty spaces in the board
* Completing the puzzle reduces the space between the characters
* Filling in the empty space in all the template strings
* Staying within 13k of available submission space :)

# Why does it say "Woman Doctor" and "Man Astronaut"?
The voices are using the speechSynthesis library of the browser, used by screen readers. That's how the emojis are read by some of the voices in screen reader. Although I was able to remove the skin tone from the emoji before speechSynthesis to avoid the browser saying things like "Man Doctor with Medium Light Skin Tone" in those clues, because of how the emojis defined, removing the gender breaks the meaning in some cases.  For example, instead of "Woman Scientist", it would just say "microscope".

# Layout
I wanted to make something I could play on my Surface Duo, so the layout is in two equal columns

# toki pona
[toki pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona) is a tiny constructed language based on Taoist principles of simplicity. It only has 137 basic words.  It's kind of like 1984's New Speak but with the exact opposite goal.
